        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Our story begins at the curb by my house, our most prestigious location as well as our flagship. It is here where the first waiters served the first customers. The reason our founder chose this location is because he wouldn't have to pay for a new location and could avoid extra taxes as well as go under the radar when it comes to the FDA and other administrative organizations.</p>
